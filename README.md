# Recreating Homepages with HTML CSS

I want to recreate as many homepages as I can so I get more experience with frontend development. I will upload the source code to every single one of them here:

## 1. Google Homepage
   - [Source Code](https://github.com/learn-webdevYT/Google-Homepage/edit/master/README.md)

## 2. DuckDuckGo Homepage
